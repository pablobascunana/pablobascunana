# Summary

Experience in all stages of the software development cycle. During my career I have always been in continuous evolution using different programming languages; starting with Android applications and continuing with web applications developed with AngularJS and VueJS. Soon after I was already taking steps in backend development using Java and Python with Flask. I am now able to take part in all stages of the software development cycle, from defining the requirements to deploying into production environments.
